Furthermore, interested computing metrics simultaneously several classifiers summarize_dataset() can used.","code":"# Summarize predictor in high sens region summarize_predictor(   data = iris_subset,   predictor = Sepal.Length,   response = Species,   threshold = 0.9,   ratio = \"tpr\" ) #> # A tibble: 1 × 5 #>     auc   pauc np_auc fp_auc curve_shape #>   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>       #> 1 0.985 0.0847  0.847  0.852 Concave  # Summarize predictor in high spec region summarize_predictor(   data = iris_subset,   predictor = Sepal.Length,   response = Species,   threshold = 0.1,   ratio = \"fpr\" ) #> # A tibble: 1 × 5 #>     auc   pauc sp_auc tp_auc curve_shape #>   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>       #> 1 0.985 0.0954  0.976  0.973 Concave # Select classifiers to compute classifiers <- c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\", \"Petal.Width\", \"Petal.Length\")  # Summarize classifiers in high sens region summarize_dataset(   data = iris_subset,   predictors = classifiers,   response = Species,   threshold = 0.9,   ratio = \"tpr\" ) #> $data #> # A tibble: 4 × 6 #>   identifier     auc   pauc np_auc fp_auc curve_shape       #>   <chr>        <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>             #> 1 Sepal.Length 0.985 0.0847 0.847   0.852 Concave           #> 2 Sepal.Width  0.166 0.0016 0.0160  0.9   Hook under chance #> 3 Petal.Width  1     0.1    1       1     Concave           #> 4 Petal.Length 1     0.1    1       1     Concave           #>  #> $curve_shape #> # A tibble: 2 × 2 #>   curve_shape       count #>   <chr>             <int> #> 1 Concave               3 #> 2 Hook under chance     1 #>  #> $auc #> # A tibble: 2 × 3 #> # Groups:   auc > 0.5 [2] #>   `auc > 0.5` `auc > 0.8` count #>   <lgl>       <lgl>       <int> #> 1 FALSE       FALSE           1 #> 2 TRUE        TRUE            3"},{"path":"https://pablopnc.github.io/ROCnGO/articles/ROCnGO.html","id":"plotting","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Automating analysis","what":"Plotting","title":"Introduction to ROCnGO","text":"seen, using roc_points() can plot ROCROC curve.
